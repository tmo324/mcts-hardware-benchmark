"""
Set of five CUDA device functions defining the mechanics of a certain game (Connect 4, Gomoku, etc.) 
required by the class ``MCTSNC`` (callable by its kernel functions) from :doc:`mctsnc`. 
The five functions are: ``is_action_legal``, ``take_action``, ``legal_actions_playout``, ``take_action_playout``, ``compute_outcome``.
To define a new custom game or a search problem the user should provide his implementations either directly as bodies of the aforementioned functions, 
or write his own device functions and forward the calls.
Currently, the module contains examples of how those functions are implemented for the games of Connect 4 and Gomoku.

Function ``is_action_legal`` is called by each of ``_expand_1_*`` kernel functions from ``MCTSNC`` class;
function ``take_action`` is called by each of ``_expand_2_*`` kernel functions; 
functions ``legal_actions_playout`` and ``take_action_playout`` are called interchangeably by each of ``_playout_*`` kernel functions;
function ``compute_outcome`` is called by each of ``_expand_2_*`` and ``_playout_*`` kernel functions.

The following arguments are common for all the functions:

    m (int): 
        number of rows in board.
    n (int): 
        number of columns in board.
    board (array[int8, ndim=2] shared or local):
        two-dimensional array of bytes representing the board of a state.
    extra_info (array[int8, ndim=1] shared or local):
        one-dimensional array with any additional information associated with a state (not implied by the contents of the board itself).
    turn {-1, 1}:
        indicator of the player, minimizing or maximizing, to act now.
        
The following arguments are function-specific:

    legal_actions (array[boolean] shared): 
        one-dimensional array of boolean flags indicating legal actions; becomes populated by multiple calls of ``is_action_legal`` made by an ``_expand_*`` kernel function of ``MCTSNC`` class.
    action (int16):
        index of action to be taken
    legal_actions_with_count (array[int16] local):
        array storing legal actions with their count to be applied within a playout; 
        its last entry contains the count of legal actions, its leftmost entries (in the number equal to that count) contain indexes of legal actions (possibly unordered); 
        becomes established within calls of ``legal_actions_playout`` or just the first such a call made by a ``_playout_*`` kernel function of ``MCTSNC`` class; 
        can be updated (but does not have to) within calls of ``take_action_playout`` to avoid future costs of legal moves regeneration during ``legal_actions_playout``.
    action_ord (int16):
        ordinal index of entry in array ``legal_actions_with_count``, picked on random by a ``xoroshiro128p`` generator within a ``_playout_*`` kernel functions of ``MCTSNC`` class;
        this entry defines the index of action to be currently taken during a playout, i.e., ``legal_actions_with_count[action_ord] == action``;
        can be used (but does not have to) within calls of ``take_action_playout`` to avoid future costs of legal moves regeneration during ``legal_actions_playout`` calls
        by placing the last available legal action (rightmost) under ``action_ord`` index just after the current action is taken.
